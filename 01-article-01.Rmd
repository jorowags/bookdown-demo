## Factual Questions

How many participants did the authors need to recruit for the study in order to detect a medium effect across three groups? _52_

Who were the participants for this study? 59 undergraduate students > 18 yo from Introductory Psychology courses at a small, midwestern university.

What was the dependent variable in the study? Ratings of trustworthiness, attractiveness, and aggression.

How many pictures did each participant see? 6. 

Were trustworthy faces rated as more attractive than other faces? If so, at what significance level? Yes, p < .001.

In what way did this study extend the Rule et al. (2013) findings? By demonstrating the powerful effect of context.

## Discussion Questions

The authors chose not to collect demographic information about the participants. Do you agree with this decision? Why or why not?

In the first paragraph of the discussion the authors state that their effect “strongly replicated the findings of Rule et al. (2013) in a quite different student sample.” What do you think this means? Do you think that it’s important that we know this? Why or why not?

The authors state that one implication of this effect might be that police respond to a suspect differently when in impoverished versus wealthy areas because of their perceived aggressiveness of the suspect. What is another implication?

Pick out a term in the statistical analysis that looks unfamiliar or confusing to you. Google the term and then describe what you learn about it.

Why were the pictures of the faces small and the pictures of the houses large?

Do you think this study would replicate in a different demographic? Why or why not?

Factual
One of…?
How many participants were there? 
How were participants recruited? 
Was there an equal number of males and females? 
How many scales did participants fill out about themselves? 
Was the Dark Triad correlated with cat dominance? If it was, was it positive or negative? If significant, at what probability level? 
Discussion
The researchers required participants to have selected the cats themselves. Would you expect the results to be different if the cats had not been selected by their owners?
The researchers provided no information about the reliability or validity of the measures they used. Does that concern you? Why / why not?
What might have participants interpreted the item “How satisfied are you with your cat?”
The researchers suggested that self-report items may be problematic. If you were redesigning the research, how would you deal with that issue?
How would you change this research to look at a different type of pet? (e.g., fish)
